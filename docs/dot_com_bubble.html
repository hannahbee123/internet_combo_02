                        During the 90's the rise of the internet steadily grew and computers became accessible in public. Due to this rise, a bunch of tech companies started to pop up in silicon valley hoping that they can
                        turn their idea into profits. Well, some companies did, but some suffered gruesome defeats. By 1999, the U.S suffered a financial crisis never seen before
                        and the rise of tech companies wanting to follow the likes of Yahoo did not survive. But there are two prominent companies that did survive and still today two of the most
                        important part of our economy: Ebay and Amazon.

He ended up selling books from countless spreadsheets that he made to determine the best product to sell. And in the summer of ‘95 Bezos launched amazon in the summer of ‘95.

                        About the same time, Omidyar had an idea to use the web to create a marketplace for auction, and to bring people together in a level playing field; where big players and small players won’t have that much of an advantage. This idea hatched into a market we know today as ebay.

                        In almost all technology inside it is a chip and probably descendants of the silicon chip. The silicon chip is governed by Moore’s law: coined by intel’s co founder Gordon Moore more than 50 years ago. Moore’s law states that: the speed and power of integrated circuits - to microprocessors to memory chips - doubles every eighteen months. This relates to engineers’ ability to make the chips smaller and smaller that resulted in amazing technology and its accessibility.

As the number of new users increases in a network, the number of connections exponentially grows. These two laws drove the connectivity of the internet to the world.

                        History tells us that every breakout technology had a pattern governed by a financial mania: a financial bubble. One famous example is the railway frenzy in the 1800s. And this pattern shows with the internet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        The pattern starts in 1995, when Netscape launched its successful browser, Navigator and went into public offering. Following that, the rise of search engines such as Yahoo and excite who went into public offering themselves. And in 1997, amazon went public. Amazon had no profits, but with exponential growth.

                        When both ebay and amazon are now ipos offered to the public, wall street had their eyes on them and were still skeptical of their business models. However, both companies did amazingly well during their first few weeks being public. Amazon’s stock price went double in a matter of months, and ebay sailed through their initial opening and exceeded expectations
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        As the public saw the success of amazon and ebay, a multitude of young, ambitious graduates flocked to silicon valley to pitch their business ideas. The accessibility of the internet and its usefulness did not stop there, it ushered in a new type of investors: the day traders. When almost everyone in the country, at that time, had access to computers in the comfort of their own homes, they spent every waking hour scouring the internet to search for gossip about how the stock market will come about that day. As a result, it ushered in the dot com boom.

                        In 2000, NASDAQ fell an astonishing 355 points bringing the end of a long boom during the 90s. And the dot com bubble popped with a lot of big tech companies like inter, sun microsystems walked off wounded. Furthermore, a lot of dot com startups fell on to their knees and went into bankruptcy leaving millions of people jobless.

                    <p class="lead">
                        The takeaway from the companies who survived the dot com bubble like amazon and ebay is that giving the power to ordinary people instead of the opposite is the way to go. Amazon Bezos’ famously, on numerous occasions, mentions the importance of valuing customers. They had a deep understanding of the needs of their customers and made their companies for the people.
