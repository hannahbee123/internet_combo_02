                    On the web today, vast amounts of information are being accessed by almost every person that has
                    access to the internet. It is hard to imagine living in today’s age without internet access and
                    access to information. Research papers, essays, and homework are made easier to do by the
                    internet. Almost all resources are available online. One key aspect of this highway of
                    information is a search engine. And the most popular search engine is Google. There is almost
                    nothing you can’t search or learn with Google. It’s the easiest way to find information on the
                    internet. Its intuitive algorithm helps pinpoint and narrow the search to make it accurate as
                    much as possible and be readily available in a heartbeat. Google is not the only search engine
                    available, but I think it is safe to say it is the most dominant search engine out there. But
                    how did it become what Google is today?

                    Two electrical engineering students, Jerry Yang, and David Filo, at Stanford University in their
                    quest to scour the web for information about their basketball fantasy draft have found
                    themselves endlessly searching for information and suddenly had an idea to make it easier for
                    themselves and organized the websites to make navigation easier. They created a website called
                    “Jerry and David’s guide to the World Wide Web”. The site was a directory of other websites,
                    organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. And it was hit and used by
                    millions of people. Their website then changed into Yahoo due to its characters being too long
                    for an easily accessible domain.

                    users, there were no ways to generate income but charge users for its application. And this is
                    where advertising came in. It ushered the way for small companies to generate income and grow to

                    As multitude of users continued to grow, companies like Yahoo and Excite reinvented themselves

                    tickers - to prevent users from leaving their site and to consume their advertisements. As a
                    result, this created an extreme competition and resulted in extreme innovations, but it is
                    unsustainable for some of the other companies who can’t keep up.

                    original page will be the first link to be shown.

                    accessible to everyone in the world. However, the same problem arises at Google: how do we make
                    money? Should they follow the likes of Yahoo and other search engines alike with their
                    advertising strategy, or to innovate a new way to advertise to generate revenue? Both original
                    investors could not think of having Google be the likes of Yahoo.

                    Bill Gross is the founder of Idealab. He found a way to curate advertisements based on keywords.
                    The idea behind Gross’s strategy is: whenever a user searches for or types a keyword in the
                    search engine it will display a related advertisement to the page. This way advertisements will
                    not look like a randomly generated advertisement and would not annoy users. Furthermore, these
                    keywords are sold to companies so every time a user types the keyword companies who bought the
                    keywords to advertise will show it to the page. Google found this idea and contacted Bill Gross
                    to have a meeting on how Google would implement Gross’s idea to its own search engine.
