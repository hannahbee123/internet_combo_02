                        On the web today, vast amounts of information are being accessed by almost every person that has
                        access to the internet. It is hard to imagine living in today’s age without internet access and
                        access to information. Research papers, essays, and homework are made easier to do by the
                        internet. Almost all resources are available online. One key aspect of this highway of
                        information is a search engine. And the most popular search engine is Google. There is almost
                        nothing you can’t search or learn with Google. It’s the easiest way to find information on the
                        internet. Its intuitive algorithm helps pinpoint and narrow the search to make it accurate as
                        much as possible and be readily available in a heartbeat. Google is not the only search engine
                        available, but I think it is safe to say it is the most dominant search engine out there. But
                        how did it become what Google is today?

                        Two electrical engineering students, Jerry Yang, and David Filo, at Stanford University in their
                        quest to scour the web for information about their basketball fantasy draft have found
                        themselves endlessly searching for information and suddenly had an idea to make it easier for
                        themselves and organized the websites to make navigation easier. They created a website called
                        “Jerry and David’s guide to the World Wide Web”. The site was a directory of other websites,
                        organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. And it was hit and used by
                        millions of people. Their website then changed into Yahoo due to its characters being too long
                        for an easily accessible domain.

                        In the mid-’90s, even though the popularity of the internet, its popularity did not generate
                        income. When Mosaic was first launched, the first web browser, even though it had millions of
                        users, there were no ways to generate income but charge users for its application. And this is
                        where advertising came in. It ushered the way for small companies to generate income and grow to
                        such an unprecedented rate.

                        grow which means more eyes on the advertisements posted on their website.

                        tickers - to prevent users from leaving their site and to consume their advertisements. As a
                        result, this created an extreme competition and resulted in extreme innovations, but it is
                        unsustainable for some of the other companies who can’t keep up.

                        counting the number of times the search terms appeared on the page. This algorithm was then
                        called PageRank; it determined a website’s rank by the number of pages it is linked to and the
                        original page will be the first link to be shown.

                        bought out. But Excite’s CEO was not impressed by Google’s program. It was not only Excite who
                        did not see Google’s full potential but almost every other company in Silicon Valley.

                        helped start Google’s uprise. And by 1999, Google received a total amount of more than 20$

                        accessible to everyone in the world. However, the same problem arises at Google: how do we make
                        money? Should they follow the likes of Yahoo and other search engines alike with their
                        advertising strategy, or to innovate a new way to advertise to generate revenue? Both original

                        Bill Gross is the founder of Idealab. He found a way to curate advertisements based on keywords.
                        The idea behind Gross’s strategy is: whenever a user searches for or types a keyword in the
                        search engine it will display a related advertisement to the page. This way advertisements will
                        not look like a randomly generated advertisement and would not annoy users. Furthermore, these
                        keywords are sold to companies so every time a user types the keyword companies who bought the
                        keywords to advertise will show it to the page. Google found this idea and contacted Bill Gross
                        to have a meeting on how Google would implement Gross’s idea to its own search engine.

                        After numerous meetings between Google and Gross, Page and Brin walked away with no any kind of
                        deal. And after a few months, Google released Adwords. Adwords is suspiciously similar to
                        Gross’s idea. Gross took Google to court and he walked away with a settlement.

                        In 2004, Google went public but with a lot of doubt within wall street because of their
                        unconventional way of selling their stocks. However, once they went public, their opening was a
                        whopping success. Their stock price never went down below $100. With Google’s success they are
                        still today one of the most dominant tech companies in the world.
