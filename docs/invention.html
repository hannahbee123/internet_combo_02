                            In 1962, ARPA hired Licklider for IPTO (Information Processing Techniques Office).
                            His idea was that computers will help us to easily share information through networks.
                            The problem was that when you connect three terminals in different locations, one terminal
                            can only talk to one terminal and not to both terminals.

                            sharing between networks, Kleinrock implemented Demand Access (You don’t get it until you
                            need it) and Distributed Control (No one switch or device should have the authority to
                            control the network, instead All devices share the authority of functions of the
                            network)</p>

                            Hot potato routing - a routing technique enabling packet routing without storing them in
                            buffers. Instead, this technique continuously transfers data packets until they reach their
                            destination without the packets having to wait or be stored in a buffer.</p>

                        <p>In 1969,
                            two universities set up the first computer network to be the recipient of the first “node-to-node” network transmission through ARPAnet. The first computer was located in a research lab at UCLA, the second was at Stanford, and lastly was in MIT, which was the lab that is to send the messages to both universities. The computer at UCLA successfully received the first message “LOGIN”, and Stanford only received the note’s first two letters. However, this breakthrough opens up new ways of communicating through multiple computers. And by the end of 1969, all computer networks at all universities were connected. Had this failed, who knows what would have happened to the internet that we know today.
