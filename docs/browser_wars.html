                    <h4>Summer of 1995</h4>
                    <p>Netscape hired an Antitrust lawyer to help them to fight Microsoft during negotiations with
                        Microsoft. During the summer of 1995, a meeting was held between Netscape and Microsoft to
                        negotiate, but what took place in that meeting was, till today, unknown. However, there are two
                        sides of the story of what took place in the meeting. Microsoft’s side of the story was the
                        meeting was as cordial and as casual as it can be, and on the other side of the aisle,
                        Netscape’s claims were different.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Netscape describes it like a scene in Godfather - Microsoft made them an offer they cannot
                        refuse- they offered Netscape one million dollars to have unlimited access to their technology.
                        If Netscape’s story was true, it means they have broken the American Antitrust Law, this law
                        constrains the behavior of companies that held a monopoly which Microsoft held due to their
                        operating system: Microsoft Windows.

                    <p>Netscape’s rise into the computer industry did not stop them from going somewhere bigger. Jim
                        Clarke urged Netscape to go public. And in its launch, they became the biggest and most fast
                        growing IPO in the history of wall street. And from there, David becomes the Goliath. At their
                        rise, Andreessen continued to pick fights with Microsoft by commenting on the public about his
                        hate or dislike about Microsoft

                        In retaliation, Microsoft launched its own web browser: Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer’s
                        team of engineers had some real advantages; vast financial resources, pools of intelligent
                        talents, and their leader, Bill Gates, who is willing to do anything to maintain their power.

                        As Netscape and Microsoft engineers continued their fight for supremacy, Microsoft had its team
                        of salesmen to negotiate under wraps to further the rise of Internet Explorer and sometimes
                        negotiations that took place were borderline illegal. Jim Clarke claimed that Microsoft told
                        Compaq, a pc manufacturer, that Microsoft will cancel their Windows license if they distribute
                        Netscape’s browser.

                        Netscape’s downfall is that Microsoft is a billion dollar company and they can do a lot with it.
                        As Netscape continued to charge its users for their browser, Microsoft launched Internet Browser
                        version 4 and made it available for free and integrated into their windows operating system. As
                        a result, Netscape had nowhere to go and at the end, Microsoft took the win and this marked the
                        end of the browser wars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Microsoft celebrates its victory, they have found a new enemy: The United States government.
                        The U.S government found Microsoft to have violated antitrust laws during their fight with
                        Netscape and Bill Gates was interrogated and appeared in court.

                        The federal judge in charge of the case against Microsoft found them guilty of taking advantage
                        of their monopoly and violating antitrust laws. The federal judge suggested that Microsoft be
                        broken up and as a result, their stock market prices plunged causing them to lose $30 billion
                        dollars overnight. However, an appeal was made and found that the judgement is too harsh and
                        rescinded its judgement to break up the company.

                        Even though Netscape lost the browser wars, they did pioneer the rise of startups that will
                        eventually take over the technology industry and will eventually give birth to google, a company
                        that made Microsoft look old.
