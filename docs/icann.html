                The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, also known as ICANN, is a non-profit
                organization that coordinates and maintains the procedures behind the many databases that are
                related to
                the namespaces or numerical spaces of the internet. ICANN is responsible for ensuring the stability
                and
                security of the Internet. It performs the technical maintenance of Central Internet Access pools and
                Domain Name System (DNS) root zone registries in accordance with the function contract ICANN has
                with
                the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). ICANN’s headquarters was originally located in
                Marina
                del Ray at the University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute, but now resides in
                Playa Vista, Los Angeles in the former Facebook offices.
            </p>
            <p>
                One very important function of ICANN is their introduction of new generic Top Level Domains, also
                known as gTLD. They have a program call the New gTLD Program which is enabling the largest expansion
                of the DNS. When talking about Top Level Domains (TLD), we are referring to the last part of an
                Internet address such as .com, .org, .net, and so on. Generic TLDs are TLDs that are not country
                specific. ICANN also manages the numbering facilities for IPv4 and IPv6 <a href="dns_ip.html">Internet
                Protocol (IP) address spaces</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                ICANN has four primary principles:
            <ol>
                <li>Preserve the operational stability of the Internet</li>
                <li>Promote competition between entities invested or interested in the Internet</li>
                <li>Achieve a broad and diverse representation of the global Internet community</li>
                <li>Develop policies that are based on the consensus of many stakeholders</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                To serve these principles, ICANN is managed by a board of directors composed of 16 members. A
                nominating committee representing all the constituencies of ICANN selects 8 of these members.
                Representatives of Supporting Organizations, which are subgroups that deal with specific parts of
                policies within ICANN’s scope, comprise 6 member positions. One seat is filled by a representative
                from an “at-large” organization. The last seat is reserved for the President and CEO of ICANN who is
                appointed by the board. The current President and CEO of ICANN is Göran Marby, an individual from
                Sweden.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2016, ICANN was essentially freed from United States government oversight when the contract ended
                between ICANN and the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA), a division of
                the U.S. Department of Commerce. This contract ended in favor of transitioning IANA’s function
                contract to what is known as the “global multistakeholder community” which basically means that
                businesses, governments, and research institutions across the globe all get to play a role in the
                decisions and policies made about the Internet. ICANN also provides a utility called WHOIS. This is
                not an acronym, it describes the function of the utility which is to find out “who is” the
                individual or entity behind a registered
                <a href="dns_ip.html">domain name</a> on the internet.
